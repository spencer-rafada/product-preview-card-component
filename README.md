## My process

For this challenge, I set a goal to use BEM notation as the naming convention for the classes and use SASS as the pre-processor of the CSS. I started by creating the divisions that I think that are useful. After setting up the HTML, I proceeded with the CSS.

### Built with

- CSS
- HTML
- SASS
- BEM Notation

### What I learned

Although not perfect, I learned BEM notation and strive to name classes with this notation. I also learned how to use a CSS pre-processor, SASS. Throughout this challenge, I learned how important it is to go to details when it comes to CSS. I appreciate the detailed-oriented process and would love to be better at it next time.

### Continued development

I found interactivity useful on this one. To really specify the details on each CSS selectors specially when I go through the media query.
